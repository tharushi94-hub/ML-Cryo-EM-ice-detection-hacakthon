# Cryo-EM-ice-detection-Mic-hacakthon
This project presents a machine learning based approach for automatically detecting ice contamination in cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) micrographs. Using expert-curated annotations from the CryoPPP dataset (EMPIAR-10532), image patches are labeled as 'BAD' or "GOOD' and used to train a convolutional Neural Network to classify if the patches are real or contaminated.

The pipeline used in this project is as follows:

Step 1: Obtaning the data from cryoPPP (Dataset used:10532)
	Each dataset will contain two folders. micrographs and ground_truth
	micrographs : This folder contains all the 2D images recorded by the detector.
	ground_truth : This folder contains coordinates of the false_positives and true particles.
		True particle coordinates: points where experts say “this is a real particle”
		False-positive coordinates: points where experts say “this is not a particle” (often ice/contamination/carbon)
	
	Output of Step 1:
		A list of micrographs + two sets of points per micrograph (true vs false)

Step 2: Preprocessing the dataset
	Before training the model micrographs were divided into smaller, fixed size patches (64×64 px). 

	BAD patches (artifact-enriched) : Square patches centered on false positive coordiates (x,y) were labeled as 'BAD'
	GOOD Patches (clean): Square patches centered on true particle coordiates (x,y) were labeled as 'GOOD'

	Code used : data_preprocessing.ipynb
	
	Output of Step 2
		A dataset of labeled patches as 'BAD' or 'GOOD'
	
Step 3: Adding FFT as a second view 
	For each patch compute a FFT patch (the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) of the patch converts the image from real space into frequency space to reveal repeating patterns and structural regularities)

	Why this helps:
	Crystalline ice produces characteristic ring patterns in frequency space.
	Thick ice reduces high-frequency content, causing the signal to drop off.
	Using both real-space and FFT information allows the model to mimic how cryo-EM experts visually assess ice quality.

	Output of Step 3
		Each patch from step 2 becomes:
			Input =[real_patch, fft_patch]
			Label = GOOD or BAD
	
Step 4: Training a CNN classifier 
	Input: a patch and its FFT
	Output: probability the patch is BAD (artifact-like)

	Output of Step 4
		A trained CNN that can score any patch {Porb(BAD | patch)}

	Code used : FFT_model_building.ipynb
	
Step 5: Scan a whole micrograph to create an ice mask
	Move a square window across the micrograph (sliding window)
	For each location extract a patch (+ FFT)
	The traned CNN outputs P(BAD)
	Combine all probabilities into a 2D map over the micrograph

	Output of Step 5
		An artifact probability map
		A binary mask after thresholding:
		1 = good region
		0 = bad region (ice/artifacts)
